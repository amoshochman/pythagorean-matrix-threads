# pythagorean-matrix-threads
Multi-threaded app that calculates euclidean distances for a list of points.

compile through javac DistanceCalculator.java
run through java DistanceCalculator.java <optional params>
  
<optional params> is an odd number of integers values separated with spaces. That is:
  P1_x, P1_y, ..., Pn_x, Pn_x, n
  Where point i = (Pi_x, Pi_y).
  
  For example, use "1 2 3 4 5" to indicate P1 = (1,2), P2 = (3,4) and 5 threads.
